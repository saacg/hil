    Returns False if the journal was empty, and True if there were journal
    entries.  Equivalently, returns True if an action was performed, and False
    if no action was performed.

    The networking server calls this function in a loop, to ensure that all
    pending network operations get processed within a reasonable amount of
    time.  The return value from this function lets the server know whether it
    should check for new journal entries, or if it should wait.  If this
    function does work, the server should immediately check again, because new
    entries might have been added in the meantime.  But, if this function
    returns immediately, the server should sleep, because there was no time
    for new entries to be added.  This keeps the networking server from
    tight-looping.
