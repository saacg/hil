# Helper script for setting up and running keystone. Most of this is taken from:

# tunable variables:

# So we can avoid repeatedly downloading the repo when developing this script:
keystone_repo=${keystone_repo:-https://git.openstack.org/openstack/keystone}

# git commit to use. Travis uses this to test against different releases of
# keystone:
keystone_commit=${keystone_commit:-master}

# virtualenv executable; on some systems it may be named something else, e.g.
# if we want to test against python 2 on a system for which python 3 is the
# default, the executable will be virtualenv2:
virtualenv_bin=${virtualenv_bin:-virtualenv}

# -e: Stop on the first failing command.
# -x: Print commands as they are executed.
set -ex

# If we're already in a virtualenv, deactivate it; we want to use one that just
# has keystone dependencies. `|| true` prevents this from failing if we're not
# in a venv.
deactivate || true

# Make sure we're in the directory containing this script; this way the user
# can call it from anywhere.
